# vehikill-room

Room configuration(s) for [vehikill.io](https://play.vehikill.io).

Feel free to fork and create your own room configurations :)

You may contact Vehikill developers at [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tKKMczp) in order to enable custom rooms.

### Custom rooms

Try not to directly edit `src/rooms/default.ts` unless it's a bug fix and/or an improvement to the default room. 

You should copy the default room as `src/rooms/your-room.ts` instead.

Once you're happy with your room configuration, you may submit it to us as a pull request. We may then add it on the server.
